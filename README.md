# Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

## Project Overview
The **Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator** is a tool designed to simulate and analyze the performance of various page replacement algorithms. The project provides a visual and statistical comparison of algorithms such as **FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and LFU**, helping users understand their efficiency in terms of page faults, execution time, and memory utilization.

This simulator is particularly useful for students, researchers, and professionals studying **operating systems and memory management techniques**. It allows users to input custom parameters and observe how different algorithms behave under varying workloads.

## Features
- **Simulation of Page Replacement Algorithms:** Includes FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and LFU.
- **Performance Analysis:** Tracks page faults, execution time, and hit/miss ratios.
- **Customizable Input:** Allows users to set the number of frames and reference strings.
- **Graphical and Statistical Output:** Visualizes algorithm performance for better understanding.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Helps in determining the most efficient algorithm for a given scenario.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Tkinter for GUI, Matplotlib for visualization)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** (Queue, Stack, HashMaps for implementation)
- **Performance Evaluation Metrics** (Page Faults, Execution Time, Hit/Miss Ratio)
