# Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

## Project Overview

This advanced web-based simulator provides an interactive exploration of page replacement algorithms, a critical component of memory management in operating systems. The application allows users to simulate and compare different page replacement strategies used by modern operating systems to efficiently manage physical memory.

## Key Features

### Supported Page Replacement Algorithms
- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: A simple page replacement strategy
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: An intelligent usage-based replacement method
- **Optimal Page Replacement**: A theoretical best-case scenario algorithm

### Technical Capabilities
-  Real-time performance visualization
-  Configurable simulation parameters
-  Detailed algorithm comparison
-  Random reference string generation
-  Interactive web interface

## Technical Components

### Frontend
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Chart.js for data visualization

### Simulation Logic
- Advanced JavaScript algorithm implementations
- Dynamic page replacement strategy comparisons
- Performance metrics calculation

## How It Works

### Memory Management Simulation
1. Input Page Reference String
   - Manually enter page numbers
   - Generate random reference string
2. Configure Frame Size
   - Select number of memory frames (1-10)
3. Choose Algorithms
   - Select algorithms to compare
4. Run Simulation
   - View detailed performance metrics
   - Analyze page fault charts
   - Compare algorithmic efficiency

## Operating System Concepts Demonstrated

### Memory Management Challenges
- Handling limited physical memory
- Efficiently swapping pages between RAM and secondary storage
- Minimizing performance overhead
- Optimizing memory access strategies

### Algorithm Comparison Insights
- **FIFO**: Simple chronological replacement
- **LRU**: Usage-based intelligent replacement
- **Optimal**: Theoretical best-case scenario

## Performance Metrics

- **Page Faults**: Number of memory page replacements
- **Fault Rate**: Percentage of page references causing replacements
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Comparative performance visualization
