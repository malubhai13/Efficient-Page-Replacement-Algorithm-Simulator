 # Efficient-Page-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulator

 Overview  
The **Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator** is a tool designed to simulate and analyze different page replacement algorithms used in operating systems for managing memory efficiently. The simulator helps visualize how various algorithms perform under different workloads, providing insights into **page faults, hit ratios, and execution efficiency**.  

##  Features  
 Supports multiple page replacement algorithms:  
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
- **Optimal Page Replacement**  
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**  
- **MRU (Most Recently Used)**  

 **Performance Analysis** – Tracks **page faults, hit ratios**, and **execution time**.  
 **Customizable Input** – Users can provide their own **page reference string** and memory frame size.  
 **Graphical & Tabular Output** – Displays results in a **clear, easy-to-understand format**.  

##  Technologies Used  
- **Python** for core implementation  
- **Matplotlib** for graphical visualization  
- **Pandas/Numpy** for data handling and analysis
